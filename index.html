    <p>Hi! My name is Jakub, but you might know me by my Github handle <a href="https://github.com/kubkon">kubkon</a>. I'm a software engineer, and an open-source addict.</p>
    <p>I am a paid <a href="https://ziglang.org">Zig</a> core team member, and I am currently focusing on first-class macOS support in Zig. I am the main author and contributor to the <a href="https://github.com/kubkon/zld">zld</a> traditional and the self-hosted Mach-O linkers, and I have been working hard ensuring that Zig's stage1 compiler and libstd are usable on the latest macOS Big Sur running on Apple Silicon (ARM64).</p>
    <p>Previously, I used to contribute a lot to the Wasm/WASI ecosystem but due to time constraints, I had to dial this down somewhat (if only days were longer...). However, that doesn't mean you will never see me contribute to this fanastic ecosystem ever again - stay tuned for more updates!</p>
    <p>If you like my open-source contributions, you can now <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/kubkon?o=esc">sponsor me on GitHub</a>.</p>
    <p>In this blog, I'll try to reflect on the more interesting aspects of my journey through the world of programming. If you would like to discuss any of the posts, feel free to drop me a line at

  <h1>My most notable contributions</h1>
  <ul class="lists">
    <li>
      <a href="https://ziglang.org">Zig</a>, where I am one of the core devs and I'm actively working on the self-hosted Mach-O linker and enhancing Zig's macOS support!
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://github.com/kubkon/zld">zld</a>, Zig's LLD drop-in replacement. This project came about as an answer to all the problems we've been having with LLD in Zig when linking MachO binaries and shared libraries. My main goal is for <em>zld</em> to alleviate those issues ensuring seamless cross-compilation to both Intel and Apple Silicon platforms in Zig.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://github.com/kubkon/wasmtime-zig">wasmtime-zig</a>, a Zig embedding of wasmtime, a toy project that allows you run Wasm/WASI from within your Zig code by embedding the wasmtime runtime.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://wasmtime.dev">wasmtime</a>, a Wasm and WASI runtime curated by the <a href="https://bytecodealliance.org">Bytecode Alliance</a> community, where I contributed and maintained the Rust implementation of the WASI spec, and also contributed a little to the fantastic <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/cap-std">cap-std</a> library - a capability-based approach at Rust's libstd.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://wasi.dev">WASI</a>, or WebAssembly System Interface, where I worked on the spec as well as the tooling such as <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/WASI/tree/master/tools/witx">witx</a>.
    </li>
    </ul>

  <h1>Huge thanks to the Zig Software Foundation and my sponsors</h1>
  <p>I'd like to extend my thanks to the Zig Software Foundation for making me a full-time individual contractor. Thank you!</p>
