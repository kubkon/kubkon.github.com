    <p>Hi! My name is Jakub Konka, but you might know me by my Github handle <a href="https://github.com/kubkon">kubkon</a>. I'm an open-source addict and recently honoured to have become <a href="https://ziglang.org">Zig</a> core team member, currently focusing on Zig's first-class macOS support. I am the main author and contributor to the self-hosted Mach-O linker in Zig, and I have been working hard ensuring that Zig's stage1 compiler and libstd are usable on the latest macOS Big Sur running on Apple Silicon (ARM64) - no kidding, you will be able to code in Zig natively on ARM64 macOS with Zig 0.7.0 release!</p>
    <p>Previously, I used to contribute a lot to the Wasm/WASI ecosystem but due to time constraints, I had to dial this down somewhat (if only days were longer...). However, that doesn't mean you will never see me contribute to this fanastic ecosystem ever again - stay tuned for more updates!</p>
    <p>Since all of this work is done in my spare time on a voluntary basis, if you like my work, please <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/kubkon?o=esc">sponsor me on GitHub</a>.</p>
    <p>In this blog, I'll try to reflect on the more interesting aspects of my journey through the world of programming. If you would like to discuss any of the posts, feel free to drop me a line at

  <h1>My most notable contributions</h1>
  <ul class="lists">
    <li>
      <a href="https://ziglang.org">Zig</a>, where I'm actively working on the self-hosted Mach-O linker and enhancing Zig's macOS support, but not only! I'm also contributing to the self-hosted codegen stage, most recently adding basic support for ARM64 to the Zig's self-hosted compiler. Last but not least, I've also contributed Windows NT syscalls wrappers to Zig's libstd, and curated Zig's support for WASI. BTW, in case you missed this, Zig offers now <a href="https://ziglang.org/#WebAssembly-Support-Table">tier 1</a> support for WASI!
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://github.com/kubkon/wasmtime-zig">wasmtime-zig</a>, a Zig embedding of wasmtime, my toy project that allows you run Wasm/WASI from within your Zig code by embedding the wasmtime runtime. I've not had the time to give this one proper love it deserves, so it's pretty dated by now, but I do intend to get back to it when I get the chance (come on days, become longer!).
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://wasmtime.dev">wasmtime</a>, a Wasm and WASI runtime curated by the <a href="https://bytecodealliance.org">Bytecode Alliance</a> community, where I contributed and maintained the Rust implementation of the WASI spec, and also contributed a little to the fantastic <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/cap-std">cap-std</a> library - a capability-based approach at Rust's libstd.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://wasi.dev">WASI</a>, or WebAssembly System Interface, where I worked on the spec as well as the tooling such as <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/WASI/tree/master/tools/witx">witx</a>.
    </li>
    </ul>

  <ul class="lists">
    <li><a href="https://www.embark-studios.com/">Embark Studios</a>, a Stockholm-based games studio, who use Rust for game-dev! How cool is that?!</li>
