    <p>Hi! My name is Jakub, but you might know me by my Github handle <a href="https://github.com/kubkon">kubkon</a>. I'm a systems programmer, and an open-source addict.</p>
    <p>I am a <a href="https://ziglang.org">Zig</a> core team member, and a member of the <a href="https://bytecodealliance.org/">Bytecode Alliance</a>. I am mainly interested in developer tooling which includes but is not limited to compilers, linkers, build systems, and cross-compilation to name but a few.</p>
    <p>In this blog, I'll try to reflect on the more interesting aspects of my journey through the world of programming. If you would like to discuss any of the posts, feel free to drop me a line at

  <h1>My most notable contributions in no particular order</h1>
  <ul class="lists">
    <li>
      <a href="https://github.com/kubkon/bold">bold</a>, a macOS system linker drop-in replacement. This project came about as an answer to all the problems we've been having with LLD in Zig when linking MachO binaries and dynamic libraries. Since then it matured into a full-fledged system linker replacement project like the mold linker but for Apple platforms.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://github.com/kubkon/zig-yaml">zig-yaml</a>, a YAML parser library written entirely in Zig. I hear that folks are actually using it which always makes me smile and chuckle a little since the project came about when I was first writing a parser for Apple's text-based definition (.tbd) format for dynamic libraries.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://ziglang.org">Zig</a>, where I am one of the core team members and contributed various things over the years including a macOS (well Mach-O) linker.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://wasmtime.dev">wasmtime</a>, a Wasm and WASI runtime curated by the <a href="https://bytecodealliance.org">Bytecode Alliance</a> community, where I contributed and maintained the Rust implementation of the WASI spec, and also contributed a little to the fantastic <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/cap-std">cap-std</a> library - a capability-based approach at Rust's libstd.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://wasi.dev">WASI</a>, or WebAssembly System Interface, where I worked on the spec as well as the tooling such as <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/WASI/tree/master/tools/witx">witx</a>.
    </li>
    </ul>
