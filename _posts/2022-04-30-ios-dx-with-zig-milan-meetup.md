title: "iOS DX with Zig: demo at Zig Milan meetup"
---

# {{ page.title }}

Specifically for the Zig meetup in Milan, I've decided to see how much I can stretch the reality of iOS development
with Zig. Some of the questions I wanted to find answers for were: do we really need Xcode to deploy apps to an
iPhone? Do we need to rely on `codesign` tool for managing signatures? If you are curious about any of those, check
out my talk from the Zig Milan meetup (link below). At some point in the near future, I will try to write it all up
providing more technical details, and that's a promise. In the meantime though, enjoy the recording of the talk!
