title: Watery electronics (or how my Macbook Air survived drowning in water)
---

# {{ page.title }}

A full week ago, I experienced something you dread reading about on the web, but never expect it to happen to you: I managed to spill an entire glass of water (approx. 250 ml) on my 10-month-old Macbook Air (MBA). As you can imagine, I was not overly pleased with the incident, and the fact that I was 1.5 weeks after tonsillectomy, did not help in the least.

However, as it turns out, my distraught was for naught. Last night (hence, 6.5 days after the incident), I decided to finally take my chances, and tried turning my MBA on. To my great surprise, it fired up fine, and thus far, does not exhibit any glitches common to electronics (and laptops in particular) exposed to liquids; for example, short-circuited keyboard, or automatic shutdowns. That, alas, does not exclude the possibility of impending corrosion.

An interesting question that comes to mind is whether it was sheer luck (in tandem with a degree of sound judgement and quick-wittedness) on my part that saved the laptop from certain oblivion, or, perhaps, Apple in its ingenuity included a precautionary moisture sensor that turns the laptop off when the moisture reaches dangerously high levels. Food for thought!

Anyhow, for completeness, I will outline the steps I have taken to save my MBA from drowning. Perhaps it will be of use if not to someone else then to me should I ever relive this dreadful experience.
