# Jakub Konka's Weblog

My first weblog. You can find it here: [jakubkonka.com](http://www.jakubkonka.com).

# Building

OK, this is a-me mainly manual since I seem to forget exactly how to build my own
blog over and over again.

```
(optional) $ rm Gemfile.lock
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
```
